# Orbital Playground

## Running it locally

```bash
npm start
```

## To do

-   [ ] Store position of each body
-   [ ] Use position to calculate gravitational forces
-   [ ] Use forces to update acceleration to update velocity to update position

# Done

-   [x] Render an SVG to the screen.
-   [x] Render an object in the SVG that changes with clock ticks.
-   [x] Calculate gravitational forces on an object
